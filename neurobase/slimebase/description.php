   	    <p>SlimeBase is the first comparative invertebrate neurogenomic  database featuring a simple and efficient user interface to facilitate  cross-species analysis of transcriptional data both qualitatively and  quantitatively. Currently, the database hosts sequence data from 6 phyla  comprised of 15 species: Mollusca 1,758,409, Arthropoda 503,800, Placozoa  107,152, Xenoturbellida 190,309, Ctenophora 78,595 and Cnidaria 2,611. The  sequence information is in the form of expressed sequence tags (EST) and the  next generation high throughput platform of 454 (Life Sciences, a Roche  company), with plans to add data produced by SOLID (AppliedBiosystems)  sequencing. The phylum Mollusca is our most expansive collection, including  data from <em>Aplysia califnornica</em>, <em>Pleurobranchaea californica</em>, <em>Tritonia diamedia</em>, <em>Melibe leonine</em>, <em>Lymnaea  stagnalis</em>, and <em>Clione limacine</em>. Also  included in SlimeBase is the published <em>Aplysia</em> EST dataset (Moroz, LL. <em>et al</em>., <strong>Cell</strong>, 2006) and the first ever single  cell transcriptome. <br />
   	      <br />
SlimeBase features an interface developed in Adobe’s Flash  CS4 which is both modular and extensible. Our interface facilitates  cross-species analysis by allowing users to perform every database action in a  single window and more importantly, on a single web page. From the interface  database users can browse, search for, and download sequences from whole  sequencing projects. Database users can also submit sequences hosted at  SlimeBase or their own sequences to SlimeBase’s BLAST and quantification  server.  The BLAST and quantification  server allows users to determine the level of abundance of query sequence in  any of our data sets, as well as produces graphical representations of each  alignment – <em>effectively enabling any user  to create a digital expression profile for any submitted sequence</em>. While  performing these tasks, users can also create a persistent custom data set from  sequences hosted at SlimeBase. These sequences can be downloaded in protein or  DNA context or submitted to the BLAST and quantification server.  <br />
<br />
In addition to SlimeBase we offer the option to utilize a  second database called BlastQuest (Farmerie, WG. <em>et al</em>., Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering 2005). BlastQuest provides  sophisticated interactive and web-enabled analysis for genomic datasets.  BlastQuest features an interface with the Gene  Ontology and the KEGG pathway databases, allowing users to browse assembled  sequences by their respective annotations. The combination of SlimeBase and  BlastQuest provides the user with all options to thoroughly and effectively  analyze sequence datasets in pace with current technology. The most recent  versions of SlimeBase and BlastQuest can be viewed at <a href="http://150.176.130.196:8888/database.php">http://150.176.130.196:8888/database.php</a>.   </p>
