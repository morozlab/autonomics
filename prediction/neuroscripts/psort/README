A basic description of the program is written as comments in
the "psort" file while biological aspects are described in
"helpwww2.html".

To run this program, perl version 5 is needed.  You might have
to modify its path information in the first line of the "psort" 
file.  In addition, it is safer to reconstruct 3 DBM files by
the command "psort -t all.seq".
