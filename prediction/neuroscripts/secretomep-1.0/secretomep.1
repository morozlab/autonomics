.SH NAME
secretomep \- predict non-classical protein secretion
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsecretomep\fP [\fB\-nosp\fP] [\fB\-s\fP] [\fB\-v\fP] [\fB\-V\fP]
[\fIfile ...\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B secretomep
produces ab initio predictions of non-classical i.e. not signal peptide
triggered protein secretion in eukaryotes. The method queries a number of other
feature prediction servers to obtain information on various post-translational
and localizational aspects of the protein, which are then integrated into
the final secretion prediction. The method is described in detail in the
reference quoted below.

.B Input

The protein sequences to process are taken from \fIfile\fP or,
if no file is specified, the standard input. The required input format
is \fBFASTA\fP. The following actions are always performed on the input
sequences prior to processing:
.TP
.B "   *"
The sequences shorter than 40 and longer than 4000 amino acids are discarded;
.TP
.B "   *"
The non-standard amino acid symbols in the sequences i.e. not
in <\fBACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY\fP> are replaced with ``A'' (Ala, alanine);
.TP
.B "   *"
The sequence names are truncated to 11 characters; special characters
(other than <\fBA-Za-z0-9+,-.\fP>) in the names are replaced with ``_''
(underscore);
.TP
.B "   *"
Nameless entries, allowed in \fBFASTA\fP format, are given unique names.
.SH
If the sequence name modifications mentioned above result in
non-unique names only the first encountered sequence with a
given name is considered. Thus, the output sequence names are always
unique.

.B Customizing the run

Even though \fBsecretomep\fP is trained to predict non-classical or leaderless
secretion, it usually gives high score to proteins entering the classical
secretory pathway (through the ER-Golgi apparatus). Therefore, the SignalP
software (\fBsignalp\fP) is run by default on the input sequences; for the proteins in which
the presence of a signal peptide is predicted a warning is added to the
output (see below).

The SignalP run can be disabled (\fB\-nosp\fP); it will cut
the execution time by up to 10%. It is not recommended, however, unless
the user is confident that the information SignalP provides is not
needed. If \fBsignalp\fP
has not been run at all a warning is added to the output (see below).

.B Output

The default output is a table in plain text; it will go
to \fIstdout\fP. For each input sequence one line of output is produced;
it constitutes one table row. The columns are:
.TP
.BI "   * " "Sequence name"
.TP
.BI "   * " "NN-score"
The average of the scores produced by the neural networks. It answers roughly
to the probability of the protein being secreted.
.TP
.BI "   * " Odds
The odds that the protein in fact is secreted.
.TP
.BI "   * " "Weighted by prior"
An estimated posterior probability that the sequence is secreted. It is
calculated by weighing the odds by a prior probability of 0.2%, which is
an estimate based on the current knowledge of non-classical secretion. Thus,
it should not be confused with the true probability as the prior probability
of non-classical secretion in the user's data set may be entirely different.
.TP
.BI "   * " Warning
A warning issued if the presence of a signal peptide in the sequence
has been predicted by SignalP or if the SignalP software has not been run
at all.
.SH
The output scores are explained in greater detail in the article
describing the method (see \fBREFERENCES\fP). 

By default, the output is sorted by sequence name. It is also possible
to sort by \fINN-score\fP (\fB\-s\fP). This is useful when a large data set
is scanned for the proteins most likely to be secreted.

By default, only the table described above is produced. The progress of the
whole prediction process can be reported continously on \fIstderr\fP
(\fB\-v\fP). This is particularly useful when large amounts of data
are to be processed resulting in long execution times (see \fBCAVEATS\fP).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-nosp
Do not run \fBsignalp\fP on the input sequences. This option is not
recommended unless the user is confident that the information \fBsignalp\fP
provides is not needed.
.TP
.B \-s
Sort the output sequences by the \fINN-score\fP they received. By default the
output is sorted by sequence name.
.TP
.B \-v
Report the progress of the whole prediction process continously
on \fIstderr\fP. If this option is not given only the final results
are printed on \fIstdout\fP.
.TP
.B \-V
Print the current version and the date of release. No other action will
be taken.
.TP
.I "file ..."
The input file(s) to process, in \fBFASTA\fP format. If no file is specified,
.I stdin
will be used instead.
.SH CAVEATS
.B secretomep
has to launch several other softwares and parse their output before the
actual predictions can be made. The whole process can be time
consuming. Therefore, when processing large amounts of data, the user
is advised to issue the following command:

     secretomep -v big.fsa >big.out

and monitor the progress on the screen. The output will be saved
in 'big.out' for later analysis.

If the execution time is expected to be so long that it is not practical
for the user to remain by the screen the whole time the following command
is useful:

     (secretomep -v big.fsa >big.out) >& big.rpt &

The progress report will then go to 'big_file.rpt', to be inspected
at all times, also from another shell. The final results will go
to 'big.out'.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 if no errors have occurred and non-zero if the execution
has been aborted. In the latter case an explanatory diagnostic message
will appear on \fIstdout\fP.
